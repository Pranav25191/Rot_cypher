# Rot_cypher
A simple ROT cipher program in python.

```
Usage: rot.py -k <key> [-e,-d,-b] -s <message>
    -k <key> ROT Key 0-25   
    [-e,-d,-b] Encrypt/Decrypt/Brute force(decrypt)  
    -s <message> String to pass into the cipher
```
### Background
I took the problem from the Mega Project List (https://github.com/karan/Projects) and implemented it via command line to learn about sys.argv function.
